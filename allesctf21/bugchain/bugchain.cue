	description: """
	You've already dipped your toes into the water and exploited a couple of Solana smart contracts. 
	Now it's time to fully jump in and exploit Solana itself! This challenge is based on a real vulnerability we
	found and reported last year.
	Your goal again is to call the flag contract with proof that you have flag tokens. But there is a catch this 
	time: we didn't mint any flag tokens!

	If you enjoy this challenge, make sure to check out the [Solana Bug Bounty program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/security/policy).
	The bounties are very generous, paid out every month and the folks over at Solana are great to work with.
