## FAQ
### What is a CTF?
CTF stands for Capture The Flag. In this context, CTF refers to a Cybersecurity
competition, where participants solve challenges to gain points. Challenges are
small security-related puzzles mimicing real-life vulnerabilities. In the
context of solana, a challenge would be a vulnerable smart contract that can be
exploited by an attacker.

### What is the purpose of this repository?
CTF challenges are the best way to learn security. However, Solana-specific
challenges are spread across the internet, and might be deleted or lost. This
repository aims to preserve Solana CTF challenges so that developers and
auditor can easily find them.

### How do I use this repository?
You can use this repository to learn solana smart contract auditing by trying
to find exploitable bugs in the challenges. Some challenges come with a Docker
container that allows you can interact with. 

### A Solana Challenge that I know isn't listed here!
