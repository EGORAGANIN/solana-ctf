## FAQ
### What is a CTF?
CTF stands for Capture The Flag. In this context, CTF refers to a Cybersecurity
competition, where participants solve challenges to gain points. Challenges are
small security-related puzzles mimicking real-life vulnerabilities. In the
context of Solana, a challenge would be a vulnerable smart contract that can be
exploited by an attacker.

### What is the purpose of this repository?
CTF challenges are one of the best way to learn security. However, Solana-specific
challenges are spread across the internet, and might be deleted or lost. This
repository aims to preserve Solana CTF challenges so that developers and
auditors can easily find them.

### How do I use this repository?
You can use this repository to learn Solana smart contract auditing by trying
to find exploitable bugs in the challenges. Some challenges come with Docker
containers that allow you to easily instantiate and interact with them.

### A Solana Challenge that I know isn't listed here!
Please create a Pull Request, or an Issue to add the missing Challenge!
